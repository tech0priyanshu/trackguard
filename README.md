#Abstract: 
#TrackGuard addresses the safety and emergency of gig workers (delivery personnel). The device worn around the neck integrates GPS navigation, and emergency responses, and improves the overall experience for riders by getting all instructions in audio mode. TrackGuard connects to Vultr stores and analyzes the data for further training, rerouting the route of the people and improving work-life balance. It will enhance the safety and security of delivery workers, such as advanced tracking systems, emergency response tools, or wearable devices that monitor health and safety conditions. It will help in optimizing delivery routes, reduce delivery times, and improve the overall efficiency of the delivery process. This could include AI-driven logistics solutions, real-time traffic analysis,  
#Problem Statement:
#Theme- Health and Well-Being
#Tracking Guard related to safety, efficiency, health, and work-life balance. It would enhance their productivity, ensure their well-being, and improve the overall experience of delivery workers in the rapidly growing gig economy. Delivery workers often face challenges such as long working hours, physical strain, safety risks, and the pressure to meet tight deadlines. These challenges can lead to fatigue, stress, and a lack of work-life balance. 
#Proposed Solution:
#Panic Button: Triggers instant emergency alerts, notifying emergency contacts or authorities.
#Real-time GPS Tracking: The wearable sends continuous location data to a cloud server, allowing live monitoring on a web interface.
#Geo-fencing: Alerts are sent when the wearer leaves predefined safe zones.
#Web Interface: Integrates Google Maps to display real-time location and panic alerts.
#Cloud Integration: Utilizes Vultr Cloud for backend data processing, ensuring scalability and reliability.
#Use of Vultr Services:
#Vultr Cloud is central to the project for handling:
#Real-time Data Processing: GPS data and panic alerts are processed and stored in the cloud, ensuring real-time tracking.
#API Hosting: Vultr hosts the backend APIs that communicate with the wearable device, receiving GPS data and sending alerts.
#Scalability: Vultr allows the system to scale efficiently as more devices and users are added.
#Database Storage: The cloud stores GPS logs, panic alert history, and geo-fence boundary data.
#Target Audience:
#The intended users are:
#Delivery Workers: Need real-time safety tracking during deliveries, especially in risky or remote areas.
#Elderly Individuals: To ensure safety and immediate response in case of emergencies or wandering outside safe zones.
#Field Workers: People working in hazardous or isolated environments who require constant monitoring for safety.
#Feasibility Analysis:
#Technical Feasibility: The system uses widely available hardware components (Arduino, GPS, SIM800L) and leverages Vultr Cloud, ensuring low development complexity. Existing frameworks for cloud integration, real-time data handling, and API hosting make it feasible.
#Resource Feasibility: Basic hardware, cloud services, and Google Maps API are cost-effective and scalable. The team has the necessary programming skills in embedded systems, web development, and cloud integration.
#Power Efficiency: Low-power components will be used, and the system will include power-saving modes. Geo-fencing can be pre-configured to account for varying network availability.
#Expected Outcomes:
#Enhanced Safety: Real-time monitoring of users, with immediate emergency response capabilities.
#Scalable Solution: Easily scalable for organizations and individual users, leveraging Vultr Cloud.
#Increased Efficiency: Allows family members, employers, or authorities to track vulnerable individuals in real-time, ensuring proactive safety measures.
#Improved  Experience: Provides users with peace of mind through reliable tracking and alert mechanisms.
